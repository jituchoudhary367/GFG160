# ðŸ’» GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Code

Welcome to my **160 Days of Code journey with GeeksforGeeks**.  
This repository documents my daily practice, learning, and growth as I solve **DSA problems, master patterns, and build interview readiness**.

## ðŸ“… **What is 160 Days of Code?**

**GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Code** is a structured challenge where students commit to solving **at least one DSA problem daily for 160 days**. It aims to:

- Strengthen Data Structures & Algorithms fundamentals
- Build consistent problem-solving habits
- Sharpen logic, optimization, and debugging skills
- Crack placements and tech interviews with confidence

---

## âš¡ **My Goals**

- Solve **minimum 1 problem per day** (aiming for 2-3 on most days)
- Cover **arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, DP, and advanced topics**
- Write **clean, optimized, interview-ready code**
- Maintain **explanations and notes** for future revision
